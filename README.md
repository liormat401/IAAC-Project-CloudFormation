# IAAC-Project-CloudFormation
This project will build a highly available 3-tier architecture through CloudFormation.

The following architecture is from AWS re/Start Grad Training - V2- Project 1 Lab:  Highly Available 3-Tier Architecture (by console).

After completing the project through the Console I decided to challenge myself doing the same architecture by IAAC- CloudFormation.
